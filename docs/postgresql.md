`vm.dirty_background_ratio`

This setting controls the percentage of the system's physical memory that can be filled with "dirty" (modified) data before the kernel starts writing the data to disk. Setting this to 0 means that the kernel will start flushing dirty data to disk immediately, which can reduce the likelihood of large I/O spikes that can affect PostgreSQL's performance.

`vm.dirty_ratio`

This setting is similar to vm.dirty_background_ratio, but it specifies the percentage of physical memory that can be filled with dirty data before the kernel _must_ start writing the data to disk. Like vm.dirty_background_ratio, setting this to 0 can help prevent large I/O spikes.

`vm.dirty_background_bytes` and `vm.dirty_bytes`

These settings are similar to vm.dirty_background_ratio and vm.dirty_ratio, respectively, but they specify the amount of memory in bytes instead of a percentage. Specifically, vm.dirty_background_bytes specifies the amount of memory that can be filled with dirty data before the kernel starts writing it to disk, and vm.dirty_bytes specifies the amount of memory that can be filled with dirty data before the kernel must start writing it to disk.

`vm.swappiness`

This setting controls the kernel's tendency to swap processes out of physical memory and onto the swap disk. Setting this to a low value (like 3) can help ensure that PostgreSQL's working set stays in physical memory as much as possible.

`kernel.sched_autogroup_enabled`

This setting controls the use of the "autogroup" feature of the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS). Disabling this feature (by setting it to 0) can help reduce scheduling latency, which can be important for PostgreSQL's performance.

`kernel.sched_min_granularity_ns`

This setting specifies the minimum amount of time (in nanoseconds) that a task can be scheduled for before it is preempted. Increasing this value (like setting it to 10000000) can help reduce scheduling overhead, which can be important for PostgreSQL's performance.

Overall, these settings aim to optimize the system for PostgreSQL's performance by reducing I/O spikes, keeping PostgreSQL's working set in physical memory as much as possible, and reducing scheduling latency.
